Hi Susan,

Here are some updates and refinements for our automation tools.

1.	2nd-in Automation
Use “ - ” as splitter to get broker information from the Clearance report. I did not create new automation version as it is a mirror update, I updated the code on the current automation tool in this folder.
2.	OFAC Automation
I created a Log sub folder in our automaton folder (OFAC folder). Automation will create a txt file named with processing date in it and write logs into the txt file. To avoid the pop-up message caused by server upgrade, automation will save the master template after every 5 intervals. I updated the new master template path on the General Tool in this folder, please let division leaders to test it tomorrow.

Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Betty
